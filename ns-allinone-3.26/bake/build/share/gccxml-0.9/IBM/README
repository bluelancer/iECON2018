IBM xlC support contributed by Hady Zalek

This is a small README file regarding gccxml support for AIX and IBM xlC.

The IBM xlC headers are not suitable for GCC and need to be adapted. The modified files may not be redistributed freely. This forces you to perform the following operations:
 ./<xlC-version>/adapt_headers.sh

This will produce corrected header files in the corresponding directory.
