Sun CC support contributed by Pierre-Olivier Gaillard

This is a small README file regarding gccxml support for Solaris and Sun CC.

The Sun CC headers are not suitable for GCC and need to be adapted. The modified files may not be redistributed freely. This forces you to perform the following operations:
 ./<CC-version>/adapt_headers.sh

This will produce corrected header files in the corresponding directory.
